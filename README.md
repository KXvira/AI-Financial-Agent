### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/AI-Financial-Agent.git
   cd AI-Financial-Agent
   ```

2. **Set up the environment automatically:**
   ```bash
   # Make setup script executable
   chmod +x setup.sh
   
   # Run setup script to create virtual environment and install dependencies
   ./setup.sh
   ```

   Alternatively, you can set up the environment manually:
   ```bash
   # Create and activate Python virtual environment
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   
   # Install dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables:**
   - Copy the .env template and edit with your credentials
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your editor
   nano .env
   ```
   - Required credentials:
     - MongoDB connection string
     - M-Pesa API keys
     - Gemini AI API key

4. **Initialize the database:**
   ```bash
   # Run database initialization script
   python scripts/initialize_database.py
   ```

5. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   # Start the FastAPI server
   python backend/app.py
   ```
   
   - Access the API documentation at http://localhost:8000/docs
   - Test the health check endpoint at http://localhost:8000/

### Development Workflow

1. **Branch Management:**
   - `main` - Production-ready code
   - `develop` - Integration branch for features
   - `feature/*` - Individual feature branches

2. **Development Process:**
   - Create a feature branch from develop
   - Implement and test your feature
   - Submit a pull request to the develop branch
   - After review and CI checks, merge to develop

3. **Code Style:**
   - Follow PEP 8 guidelines for Python code
   - Use type hints to improve code clarity
   - Document all functions and classes with docstrings

### Deployment

#### Local Development
```bash
# Run with auto-reload for development
uvicorn backend.app:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

#### Docker Deployment
```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t ai-financial-agent .

# Run the container
docker run -p 8000:8000 --env-file .env ai-financial-agent
```

#### Production Deployment

For production deployment, we recommend:
1. Using a production-grade ASGI server like Uvicorn behind Nginx
2. Setting up proper database credentials and connection pooling
3. Configuring SSL/TLS for secure API access
4. Setting environment variables for production settings

Example production setup command:
```bash
# Run with Gunicorn for production
gunicorn -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:8000 backend.app:app
```

  ```bash
  # Test M-Pesa API connectivity
  python -c "from backend.mpesa.service import MpesaService; import asyncio; asyncio.run(MpesaService().get_access_token())"
  ```

- **Logs:**
  - Application logs are stored in the `logs` directory
  - Use `tail -f logs/app.log` to view live logs
