# 🚀 New Repository Creation - Action Steps

## ✅ Current Status
Your local repository has been updated with:
- ✅ Sprint audit report (comprehensive analysis)
- ✅ Sprint 5-7 implementation plan (detailed roadmap)

## 🎯 Next Steps - Choose Your Path

### Option A: Create Brand New Repository (Recommended)

#### Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub
1. **Go to GitHub:** https://github.com/new
2. **Repository Settings:**
   ```
   Repository name: FinGuard-Lite-Enhanced
   Description: AI-Powered Financial Management System for Kenyan SMEs - Enhanced with comprehensive audit and Sprint 5-7 roadmap
   Visibility: Private (recommended for now)
   ✅ Do NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license
   ```

#### Step 2: Push to New Repository
```bash
# Add new remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add enhanced https://github.com/21407alfredmunga/FinGuard-Lite-Enhanced.git

# Push current branch to new repository
git push -u enhanced somechanges

# Optional: Push to main branch
git checkout -b main
git push -u enhanced main
```

### Option B: Fork and Enhance Current Repository

#### Step 1: Fork on GitHub
1. Go to: https://github.com/KXvira/AI-Financial-Agent
2. Click "Fork" button
3. Choose your account as destination
4. Rename to "FinGuard-Lite-Enhanced" (optional)

#### Step 2: Update Remote
```bash
# Update origin to your fork (replace YOUR_USERNAME)
