# ‚úÖ Invoice Items Fixed - Line Totals Now Display

**Date:** October 14, 2025 22:06  
**Issue:** Invoice line items showing "Amount: KES 0"  
**Status:** FIXED ‚úÖ

---

## üîß What Was Wrong

### Problem
When viewing invoice details, the line items showed:
- **Item 1:** Quantity: 2, Price: KES 139,635.72, **Amount: KES 0** ‚ùå
- **Item 2:** Quantity: 3, Price: KES 102,694.48, **Amount: KES 0** ‚ùå

### Root Cause
The backend code was looking for `total_price` field in invoice_items, but the normalized database uses `line_total`.

**Incorrect Code:**
```python
"amount": item_doc.get('total_price', 0)  # Returns 0 (field doesn't exist)
```

**Database Actually Has:**
```json
{
  "quantity": 2,
  "unit_price": 139635.72,
  "line_total": 279271.44,  ‚Üê This field!
  "product_snapshot": {
    "name": "Product Name"
  }
}
```

## ‚úÖ What Was Fixed

### Files Updated
**`/backend/invoices/router.py`**

### Changes Made

#### 1. Fixed Field Name
Changed `total_price` ‚Üí `line_total`

#### 2. Improved Product Description
Now uses `product_snapshot.name` for better descriptions:

```python
# Use product_snapshot for better description
product_name = ''
if 'product_snapshot' in item_doc and item_doc['product_snapshot']:
    product_name = item_doc['product_snapshot'].get('name', '')

description = item_doc.get('description', '')
if product_name and description:
    full_description = f"{product_name} - {description}"
elif product_name:
    full_description = product_name
else:
    full_description = description or 'Service/Product'

items.append({
    "description": full_description,
    "quantity": item_doc.get('quantity', 0),
    "unit_price": item_doc.get('unit_price', 0),
    "amount": item_doc.get('line_total', 0),  # ‚Üê Fixed!
})
```

## üìä Test Results

### Before Fix
```
Item 1: Service/Product
  Quantity: 2
  Price: KES 139,635.72
  Amount: KES 0  ‚ùå
```

### After Fix
```
Item 1: Product Name - Service/Product
  Quantity: 2
  Unit Price: KES 139,635.72
  Amount: KES 279,271.44  ‚úÖ
```

### Verification
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/invoices/by-number/INV-202402361"
```

**Result:**
```
Client: Business 54

- Item 2: 308,083.44
- Subtotal: 587,354.88
- Tax (16%): 93,976.78

## üìã Normalized Schema - Invoice Items

### Collection: `invoice_items`

**Fields Used:**
```javascript
{
  "item_id": "uuid",
  "invoice_id": "uuid",           // Links to invoices
  "product_id": "uuid",            // Links to products
  "description": "string",
  "quantity": 2,
  "unit_price": 139635.72,
  "line_total": 279271.44,        // ‚Üê This is the field we need!
  "currency": "KES",
  "tax_rate": 0.16,
  "product_snapshot": {
    "sku": "PRD-1030",
    "name": "Product Name"         // ‚Üê Better description
  }
}
```

### Why `product_snapshot`?
The `product_snapshot` stores the product details at the time of invoice creation. This is important because:
- Product names/prices might change over time
- Historical invoices should show what was sold at that time
- Preserves data integrity for auditing

## üîç About the "Failed to Fetch" Error

You mentioned there's a "Failed to fetch" error when trying to enter manual payment entry. This is likely a separate issue with the payment entry endpoint or form validation.

**Possible Causes:**
1. **Missing Payment Endpoint** - Frontend calling an endpoint that doesn't exist
2. **Validation Error** - Form data not matching expected schema
3. **CORS Issue** - Cross-origin request blocked
4. **Authentication** - Token expired or missing

**To Debug:**
- Check browser console (F12) for error details
- Check backend logs for API errors
- Verify the payment entry form is sending correct data format

**Would you like me to investigate the payment entry issue next?**
