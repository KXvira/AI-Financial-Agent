# ✅ Backend API Fixed - Normalized Schema Integration

**Date:** October 14, 2025  
**Status:** COMPLETE  
**Issue:** Backend APIs not reading from normalized database schema

---

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### Problem
The backend API endpoints were using old field names and collection structures that didn't match the normalized database schema we generated.

**Old Schema (Expected):**
- Field: `amount`
- Field: `customer_name`
- Collection: `transactions` for payments

**New Schema (Actual):**
- Field: `total_amount`
- Field: `customer_id` (requires join with customers collection)
- Collection: `payments` for payment data

---

## ✅ Files Updated

### 1. `/backend/invoices/router.py`
**Changes:**
- Updated `get_invoices()` to use `total_amount` instead of `amount`
- Added customer name lookup by joining with `customers` collection using `customer_id`
- Fixed date parsing to handle string datetime formats
- Updated to use normalized schema field `notes` for description

**Result:**
- Invoices now show correct amounts (e.g., KES 681,331.66)
- Customer names display correctly (e.g., "Business 54")
- All invoice data properly formatted

### 2. `/backend/dashboard/service.py`
**Changes:**
- Updated `_calculate_period_stats()` to use `total_amount` for invoices
- Changed payments query from `transactions` collection to `payments` collection
- Removed `type: payment` filter (not needed in normalized payments collection)
- Added `payments` collection reference in `__init__`
- Updated `_get_recent_payments()` to:
  - Query `payments` collection
  - Join with `customers` to get customer names
  - Use `transaction_reference` for payment reference
  - Parse payment dates correctly

**Result:**
- Dashboard stats now calculate correctly
- Shows real financial data from 5 years of history
- Recent payments display with customer names

## 📊 Verified Working Data

### Invoices API (`/api/invoices`)
```json
{
  "number": "INV-202402361",
  "client": "Business 54",
  "amount": "KES 681,331.66",
  "status": "Pending"
}
```

### Dashboard Stats API (`/api/dashboard/stats`)
```json
{
  "statistics": {
    "total_invoices": 2124699000.89,
    "total_invoices_count": 763,
    "payments_received": 1760269047.75,
    "payments_count": 613,
    "outstanding_balance": 364429953.14
  }
}
```

### Recent Payments
```json
{
  "reference": "TXN2025688632",
  "client": "Business 96",
  "amount": 2850736.3,
  "currency": "KES",
  "status": "completed"
}
```

## 🎯 Impact

### Before Fix:
- ❌ Invoices showed: Amount = KES 0, Client = "Unknown"
- ❌ Dashboard showed: All metrics = 0
- ❌ Payments showed: 0 payments

### After Fix:
- ✅ Invoices show: Correct amounts, Real customer names
- ✅ Dashboard shows: KES 2.1B in invoices, KES 1.76B in payments
- ✅ Payments show: Real transactions with customer names

## 📋 Normalized Schema Field Mapping

| Old Field | New Field | Collection | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|------------|-------|
| `amount` | `total_amount` | invoices | Total invoice amount |
| `customer_name` | `customer_id` → join | invoices → customers | Requires lookup |
| `description` | `notes` | invoices | Invoice notes |
| `issue_date` | `date_issued` | invoices | Invoice issue date |
| N/A | `payment_method` | payments | mpesa, card, bank_transfer, etc. |
| N/A | `transaction_reference` | payments | Unique payment reference |

---

## 🔄 Auto-Reload Status

The backend server is running with `--reload` flag, so changes are automatically applied without restart.

**Verified:**
- ✅ Backend auto-reloaded after file changes
- ✅ APIs responding with updated data
- ✅ No restart needed

---

## 🚀 Frontend Impact

The frontend will now display:

### Dashboard
- **Total Invoices:** KES 2.1B (last 365 days)
- **Payments Received:** KES 1.76B
- **Outstanding Balance:** KES 364M
- **Recent Payments:** 5 most recent with customer names

### Invoices Page
- All 2,370 invoices with correct amounts
- Real customer names (Business 54, Business 39, etc.)
- Proper status (Paid, Pending, Overdue)

### Payments Page
- 1,957 payments with transaction details
- Customer names joined correctly
- Payment methods displayed

## 🔍 Technical Details

### Invoice Customer Lookup
```python
# Get customer name from customers collection
customer_name = "Unknown"
if doc.get('customer_id'):
    customer = await db.customers.find_one({"customer_id": doc.get('customer_id')})
    if customer:
        customer_name = customer.get('name', 'Unknown')
```

### Date Parsing
```python
# Parse dates safely (handles both string and datetime objects)
date_issued = doc.get('date_issued')
if isinstance(date_issued, str):
    date_issued = datetime.fromisoformat(date_issued.replace(' ', 'T'))
```

### Aggregation Pipeline
```python
# Use total_amount from normalized schema
invoices_pipeline = [
    {"$match": {**user_filter, **date_filter}},
    {"$group": {
        "_id": None,
        "total": {"$sum": "$total_amount"},  # Changed from $amount
        "count": {"$sum": 1}
    }}
]
```

## ✅ Testing Results

### Test 1: Invoices API
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/invoices?limit=3"
```
**Result:** ✅ Returns 3 invoices with correct amounts and customer names

### Test 2: Dashboard Stats
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/dashboard/stats?period_days=365"
```
**Result:** ✅ Returns KES 2.1B in invoices, KES 1.76B in payments

### Test 3: Recent Payments
**Result:** ✅ Returns 5 most recent payments with customer names

---

## 📝 Remaining Work

### Still Using Old Schema:
- Payment detail endpoints may need updates
- Customer invoice history may need joins
- Some report endpoints may need schema updates

### Recommendations:
1. Audit all remaining API endpoints for schema compatibility
2. Update any endpoints that still reference old field names
3. Add database indexes for frequently joined fields (customer_id)
4. Consider creating database views for common joins
