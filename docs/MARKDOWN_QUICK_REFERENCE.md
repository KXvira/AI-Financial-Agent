### What Was Done

1. **Installed Markdown Rendering Libraries**

   ```

2. **Updated AIChat Component**
   - Replaced custom 80-line regex parser
   - Now uses `react-markdown` professional library
   - Added custom Tailwind CSS styling for all elements

3. **Result**
   - Headers render as large, bold text
   - Lists show clean numbered/bullet formatting
   - Bold text is properly emphasized
   - Tables display beautifully with borders
   - Code blocks have syntax styling
   - Professional, easy-to-read appearance

## How to Test

1. **Go to AI Insights page**: http://localhost:3000/ai-insights
2. **Ask any financial question**, for example:
   - "What are my top revenue sources?"
   - "Show me a financial summary"
   - "Analyze my transaction patterns"

3. **Observe the formatted response**:
   - ✅ Headers should be large and bold
   - ✅ Lists should be numbered (1, 2, 3) not asterisks
   - ✅ Bold text should stand out
   - ✅ NO raw Markdown symbols (##, **, etc.)
