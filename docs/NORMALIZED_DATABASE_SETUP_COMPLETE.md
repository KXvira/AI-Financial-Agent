## üîó Normalized Structure Verification

### ‚úÖ All Relationships Verified

1. **Invoice ‚Üí Customer**
   - Every invoice references a valid customer
   - No embedded customer data
   - Query: `db.invoices.aggregate([{$lookup: {...}}])`

2. **Invoice Items ‚Üí Invoice**
   - All items linked to valid invoices
   - Separate collection for analytics
   - Query: `db.invoice_items.find({invoice_id: "..."})`

3. **Invoice Items ‚Üí Product**
   - Items reference products with snapshot for history
   - Product changes don't affect old invoices
   - Query: `db.invoice_items.aggregate([{$lookup: {...}}])`

4. **Payments ‚Üí Invoice**
   - Payments linked to invoices and customers
   - Supports multiple payments per invoice
   - Query: `db.payments.find({invoice_id: "..."})`

5. **Payment Gateway Data ‚Üí Payment**
   - Gateway-specific data separated
   - Clean payment record with details on demand
   - Query: `db.payment_gateway_data.find({payment_id: "..."})`

## üìã Database Schema Summary

### Key Design Decisions

#### ‚úÖ What We Normalized

1. **Customers Extracted**
   - Previously: Embedded in every invoice
   - Now: Separate collection, referenced by ID
   - Benefit: Update customer once, reflects everywhere

2. **Invoice Items Separated**
   - Previously: Embedded array in invoice
   - Now: Separate collection with references
   - Benefit: Powerful analytics, better queries

3. **Payments Unified**
   - Previously: Scattered across multiple collections
   - Now: Single payments collection + gateway data
   - Benefit: Complete payment history, easier reporting

4. **Products Created**
   - Previously: No product catalog
   - Now: Central product repository
   - Benefit: Consistent pricing, product management

5. **Audit Trail Added**
   - Previously: No tracking
   - Now: Complete audit log
   - Benefit: Full accountability and history

#### ‚úÖ What We Preserved (Embedded)

1. **Customer Address** - Embedded in customer (rarely queried alone)
2. **User Preferences** - Embedded in user (personal settings)
3. **Product Snapshot** - Embedded in invoice items (historical accuracy)

## üîç Sample Queries

### Get Invoice with All Details
```javascript
db.invoices.aggregate([
  { $match: { invoice_number: "INV-2024000" } },
  {
    $lookup: {
      from: "customers",
      localField: "customer_id",
      foreignField: "customer_id",
      as: "customer"
    }
  },
  { $unwind: "$customer" },
  {
    $lookup: {
      from: "invoice_items",
      localField: "invoice_id",
      foreignField: "invoice_id",
      as: "items"
    }
  },
  {
    $lookup: {
      from: "payments",
      localField: "invoice_id",
      foreignField: "invoice_id",
      as: "payments"
    }
  }
])
```

### Customer Purchase History
```javascript
db.invoices.aggregate([
  { $match: { customer_id: "customer_uuid_here" } },
  { $sort: { date_issued: -1 } },
  {
    $lookup: {
      from: "invoice_items",
      localField: "invoice_id",
      foreignField: "invoice_id",
      as: "items"
    }
  },
  {
    $project: {
      invoice_number: 1,
      date_issued: 1,
      total_amount: 1,
      status: 1,
      item_count: { $size: "$items" }
    }
  }
])
```

### Top Selling Products
```javascript
db.invoice_items.aggregate([
  {
    $group: {
      _id: "$product_id",
      total_quantity: { $sum: "$quantity" },
      total_revenue: { $sum: "$line_total" }
    }
  },
  { $sort: { total_revenue: -1 } },
  { $limit: 10 },
  {
    $lookup: {
      from: "products",
      localField: "_id",
      foreignField: "product_id",
      as: "product"
    }
  },
  { $unwind: "$product" }
])
```

### Payment Methods Analysis
```javascript
db.payments.aggregate([
  {
    $group: {
      _id: "$payment_method",
      count: { $sum: 1 },
      total_amount: { $sum: "$amount" }
    }
  },
  { $sort: { total_amount: -1 } }
])
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Next Steps

### For Development

1. **Update Application Code**
   - Use the models in `backend/models/normalized_models.py`
   - Update queries to use references instead of embedded data
   - Add `$lookup` aggregations where needed

2. **API Endpoints**
   - Update invoice endpoints to return joined data
   - Add customer management endpoints
   - Add product management endpoints

3. **Testing**
   - Test all CRUD operations
   - Verify relationships work correctly
   - Check query performance

### For Production

1. **Data Migration** (if you had real data)
   - Use `scripts/normalize_database.py` to migrate
   - Run `scripts/verify_normalization.py` to verify
   - Keep backup of original data

2. **Monitoring**
   - Set up index usage monitoring
   - Track query performance
   - Monitor collection sizes

3. **Documentation**
   - Update API documentation
   - Document new data model
   - Train team on new structure

print(collections)

# Check relationships
invoice = await db.invoices.find_one()
customer = await db.customers.find_one({"customer_id": invoice["customer_id"]})
print(f"Invoice {invoice['invoice_number']} belongs to {customer['name']}")
