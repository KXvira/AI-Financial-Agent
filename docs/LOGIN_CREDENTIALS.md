## üîí What Was Fixed

### Problem:
- Users were created with an incorrect password hash
- The hash in the database didn't match "password123"
- All login attempts were failing with "Invalid email or password"

### Solution:
- Generated a new, correct bcrypt hash for "password123"
- Updated all 8 users in the database with the correct hash
- Verified the hash works with bcrypt.checkpw()

### Technical Details:
```python
# Old (broken) hash:
"$2b$12$LQv3c1yqBWVHxkd0LHAkCOYz6TtxMQJqhN8/LewY5GyYIeWU9uXMO"

# New (working) hash:
"$2b$12$HJ2opNEh77mAk/29C6dqEemUz.4gASa..inBvZaVbX5WneYzodrf6"
```
