# Phase 1 Implementation - Day 1 Progress

## âœ… Completed

### 1. Backend Models (`backend/reporting/models.py`)
Created comprehensive Pydantic models for all report types:
- âœ… `ReportRequest`, `DateRangeFilter`, `ExportRequest` - Request models
- âœ… `IncomeStatementReport` with `RevenueSection` and `ExpenseSection`
- âœ… `CashFlowReport` with `CashFlowInflows` and `CashFlowOutflows`
- âœ… `ARAgingReport` with `AgingBucket` model
- âœ… `DashboardMetrics` - KPI metrics model
- âœ… `ReportTypeInfo` and `ReportTypesResponse` - Report metadata
- âœ… `ReportError` - Error handling model

**Status:** âœ… **COMPLETE** - All models defined and ready to use

## ðŸ”„ In Progress

### 2. Backend Service (`backend/reporting/service.py`)
Need to create the ReportingService class with methods for:
- `get_report_types()` - List available reports
- `generate_income_statement()` - Income statement generation
- `generate_cash_flow()` - Cash flow statement generation
- `generate_ar_aging()` - AR aging report generation
- `get_dashboard_metrics()` - Dashboard KPIs

**Status:** ðŸ”„ **IN PROGRESS** - Models ready, need to create service file

**Next Step:** Create a clean `service.py` file

---

## ðŸ“‹ Remaining Tasks for Day 1-2

### 3. Backend Router (`backend/reporting/router.py`)
Create FastAPI endpoints:
- `GET /api/reports/types` - List report types
- `GET /api/reports/income-statement` - Generate income statement
- `GET /api/reports/cash-flow` - Generate cash flow
- `GET /api/reports/ar-aging` - Generate AR aging
- `GET /api/reports/dashboard-metrics` - Get dashboard metrics

### 4. Update Main App (`backend/standalone_app.py`)
- Import reporting router
- Register router with FastAPI app
- Test that all services load

### 5. Test Backend
- Start backend server
- Test each endpoint with Postman or curl
- Verify data accuracy

## Implementation Strategy

Given the file corruption issues, let's use a different approach:

### **Option A: Create Service Incrementally**
1. Create minimal service.py with just `get_report_types()` 
2. Test it works
3. Add `generate_income_statement()`
4. Test it works
5. Continue adding methods one at a time

### **Option B: Copy from Working Demo Script**
1. Use logic from `scripts/generate_income_statement.py` (which we know works!)
2. Adapt it to work with the new models
3. This ensures we're building on proven code

---

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Create minimal service.py** with just imports and class definition
2. **Add one method at a time** and test each
3. **Create router.py** with endpoints
4. **Test each endpoint** as we build
5. **Move to frontend** once backend is solid

Would you like me to:
A) Start with a minimal service.py and build incrementally?
B) Create the router first and we'll add service methods as needed?
C) Focus on getting just Income Statement working end-to-end first?
