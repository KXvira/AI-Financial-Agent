# Recent Updates: M-Pesa Integration with Gemini AI

## Database Models Implementation

We've implemented the necessary database models for handling M-Pesa transactions and reconciliation:

1. **Transaction Model**: Handles all payment transaction data including M-Pesa payments
2. **Invoice Model**: Contains invoice data for reconciliation
3. **Customer Model**: Manages customer information
4. **Reconciliation Model**: Tracks reconciliation logs and results

## Database Service

- Created MongoDB connection service using Motor for async operations
- Implemented CRUD operations for all models
- Added specialized queries for reconciliation workflows
- Set up indexes for optimized query performance

## M-Pesa Service Updates

- Connected M-Pesa service with the database for transaction persistence
- Integrated callback handling with reconciliation service
- Added error handling and logging throughout the payment flow
- Implemented payment status tracking

## Reconciliation Service Updates

- Connected reconciliation service with Gemini AI
- Implemented basic reconciliation logic for fallback when AI is unavailable
- Added batch reconciliation processing for transaction batches
- Integrated database for storing reconciliation results

## Configuration Updates

- Created requirements.txt with all necessary dependencies
- Added setup.sh script for environment setup
- Created .env template for configuration
- Updated main app.py to connect all components

## Next Steps

1. **Database Connection Test**: Test database connectivity and CRUD operations
2. **End-to-End Flow Testing**: Test the entire payment flow from STK Push to reconciliation
3. **Frontend Dashboard**: Implement the frontend dashboard for visualizing reports
4. **Unit Tests**: Add comprehensive test coverage
5. **Documentation**: Complete API documentation
6. **Deployment**: Set up production deployment

## Usage Instructions

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory
2. Run the setup script: `bash setup.sh`
3. Update the .env file with your API keys
4. Initialize the database: `python scripts/initialize_database.py`
5. Start the application: `python backend/app.py`
