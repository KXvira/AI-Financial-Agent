## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of AI-Financial-Agent seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### How to Report

1. **DO NOT** open a public issue
2. Email security concerns to: **21407alfredmunga@gmail.com** (or repository owner)
3. Include detailed information:
   - Type of vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if available)

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 7 days
- **Fix Timeline**: 
  - Critical vulnerabilities: 24-72 hours
  - High severity: 7-14 days
  - Medium severity: 30 days
  - Low severity: 90 days

### What to Expect

- Acknowledgment of your report
- Regular updates on the fix progress
- Credit in the security advisory (if desired)
- Coordination on public disclosure timing

## Security Measures

### Authentication & Authorization

#### Current Implementation
- ‚úÖ JWT-based authentication with access and refresh tokens
- ‚úÖ Bcrypt password hashing (12 rounds)
- ‚úÖ Role-based access control (RBAC)
- ‚úÖ Failed login attempt tracking
- ‚úÖ Account lockout after 5 failed attempts
- ‚úÖ Session management with token expiration
- ‚úÖ Audit logging for authentication events

#### Best Practices
- Change default credentials immediately after installation
- Use strong passwords (minimum 8 characters, uppercase, lowercase, digits, special characters)
- Rotate JWT secrets regularly
- Review user permissions quarterly
- Enable multi-factor authentication (roadmap item)

### Data Protection

#### Sensitive Data Handling
- üîí **Never commit** `.env` files or credentials to git
- üîí All sensitive environment variables in `.env` file
- üîí MongoDB connection strings encrypted in transit (TLS/SSL)
- üîí API keys for external services (Gemini, MailerSend) stored securely
- üîí Customer financial data encrypted at rest (MongoDB encryption)

#### Current Protections
```bash
# Already in .gitignore
.env
.env.local
.env.*.local
*.key
*.pem
credentials.json
secrets/
```

### API Security

#### Implemented Protections
- ‚úÖ CORS configuration for frontend domains
- ‚úÖ Rate limiting on sensitive endpoints (roadmap)
- ‚úÖ Input validation with Pydantic models
- ‚úÖ SQL injection prevention (NoSQL, but input sanitized)
- ‚úÖ XSS prevention in frontend (React escaping)
- ‚úÖ CSRF protection for state-changing operations

#### Headers
```python
# Security headers (recommended to add)
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'
```

### Database Security

#### MongoDB Security Checklist
- ‚úÖ Authentication enabled (MongoDB Atlas)
- ‚úÖ Network access restricted (IP whitelist)
- ‚úÖ Connection over TLS/SSL
- ‚úÖ Audit logging enabled
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Database-level encryption (Atlas default)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Field-level encryption for PII (recommended)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Regular backups (Atlas automated)

#### Collection-Level Security
- Users: Passwords hashed with bcrypt
- Audit logs: Immutable, append-only
- Financial data: Access controlled by user roles

### Third-Party Dependencies

#### Regular Updates
```bash
# Check for vulnerabilities
pip audit  # Python dependencies
npm audit  # Node.js dependencies

# Update dependencies
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
npm update
```

#### Known Vulnerabilities
- Monitor GitHub Security Advisories
- Subscribe to security mailing lists
- Use Dependabot or similar tools

### Infrastructure Security

#### Production Deployment
```yaml
Recommended Security Measures:
- Deploy behind reverse proxy (nginx/Apache)
- Use firewall (UFW, iptables)
- Enable HTTPS/TLS (Let's Encrypt)
- Regular OS security updates
- Intrusion detection system (fail2ban)
- Log monitoring and alerting
- Container security scanning (if using Docker)
```

#### Environment Variables
```bash
# CRITICAL: Never expose these
JWT_SECRET_KEY=<random-256-bit-key>
MONGO_URI=<mongodb-connection-string>
GEMINI_API_KEY=<google-gemini-key>
MAILERSEND_API_KEY=<mailersend-key>

# Generate secure secrets:
python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"
```

### File Upload Security

#### Current Implementation
- Receipt/Invoice uploads stored in `/storage` directory
- File type validation (PDF, images)
- File size limits enforced
- Virus scanning (recommended to add)

#### Recommendations
```python
# Add to upload handler
ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS = {'.pdf', '.png', '.jpg', '.jpeg'}
MAX_FILE_SIZE = 10 * 1024 * 1024  # 10MB

# Validate file type by content, not extension
import magic
mime = magic.from_buffer(file_content, mime=True)
```

### Payment Gateway Security

#### M-Pesa Integration
- ‚úÖ API credentials stored in environment variables
- ‚úÖ HTTPS for all payment communications
- ‚úÖ Transaction verification before processing
- ‚úÖ Webhook signature validation
- ‚ö†Ô∏è PCI DSS compliance (if storing card data - NOT recommended)

### Logging & Monitoring

#### Security Events Logged
- Authentication attempts (success/failure)
- Authorization failures
- Password changes
- User creation/deletion
- Sensitive data access
- API rate limit violations

#### Log Protection
```python
# Logs stored in /logs directory
- Rotate logs daily
- Retain for 90 days minimum
- Restrict access (chmod 600)
- Encrypt sensitive log data
- Monitor for suspicious patterns
```
