The system currently has:
  ‚úÖ 413 invoices in the database
  ‚úÖ 10 expense receipts
  ‚úÖ AR Aging report working (KES 1.03B outstanding)
  ‚ùå Income Statement showing ZERO revenue
  
The income statement issue is because:
  - Invoices don't have proper 'issue_date' or 'date' fields
  - OR the date format/field name doesn't match what the code expects
  
SOLUTION: We need to either:
  1. Fix the income statement code to handle the existing invoice date format
  2. Update existing invoices to have proper date fields
  3. Create new test invoices with correct date structure

Since we have 413 existing invoices showing in AR aging, the best approach is to
FIX THE CODE to work with the existing data structure.

print("""
Instead of creating new data, let's fix the income statement service to:
1. Use the same date field logic as AR aging (which works)
2. Handle missing dates by using 'created_at' as fallback
3. Not filter out invoices with empty date strings

The AR aging report successfully finds and displays 413 invoices, so the data
EXISTS - we just need to access it correctly in the income statement.
