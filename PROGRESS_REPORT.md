   - Simulates querying Munga's analytics_cache collection

2. **Generation**:
   - Uses Google Gemini SDK (gemini-1.5-flash model)
   - Sophisticated prompt engineering for Kenyan SMB context
   - Comprehensive error handling

3. **Response**:
   - Structured JSON responses
   - Actionable insights and recommendations
   - Context-aware financial analysis

#### **API Integration**
- FastAPI framework with automatic OpenAPI documentation
- Proper error handling with HTTP status codes
- CORS support for frontend integration
- Comprehensive logging

### 📊 **Example API Responses**

#### Query: "What is my current financial status?"
```json
{
  "answer": "Based on the provided data, your business shows a decline in revenue from June 2025 (KES 220,000) to July 2025 (KES 155,000). There are currently KES 45,000 (INV-2025-071) and KES 12,500 (INV-2025-073) in overdue invoices. Recent payment processing shows a high success rate (98 out of 100 transactions in the last 30 days)..."
}
```

#### Query: "Are there any overdue invoices?"
```json
{
  "answer": "Yes, there are two overdue invoices. Invoice INV-2025-071 for KES 45,000 and invoice INV-2025-073 for KES 12,500. These total KES 57,500 in outstanding receivables that require immediate attention for collection."
}
```

### 🚀 **How to Use**

#### **Option 1: Standalone Version (Recommended for Testing)**
```bash
# Start the service
cd /home/munga/Desktop/projects/AI-Financial-Agent
python main.py

# Test the service
python test_main_service.py

# Access API documentation
# Visit: http://localhost:8001/docs
```

#### **Option 2: Integrated Version (For Production)**
```bash
# Start the main backend
cd /home/munga/Desktop/projects/AI-Financial-Agent
PYTHONPATH=/home/munga/Desktop/projects/AI-Financial-Agent python backend/app.py

# Test the service
python scripts/test_ai_insights.py
```

### 🎯 **Next Steps for Team Integration**

#### **For Diana (Frontend)**
- Use the `/ai/ask` endpoint to integrate conversational AI
- Display AI responses in a chat-like interface
- Example integration code provided in documentation

#### **For Kevo (Backend/Database)**
- Replace mock data with real MongoDB connections
- Optimize database queries for AI retrieval
- Implement proper indexing strategies

#### **For Muchamo & Biggie (Services)**
